# kMeans on Apache Flink
Implementation of different variations of K-Means algorithm on Apache Flink.

k-means [1] is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms. 
In this project we implement k-means and some of its variations and extensions:

1. Original k-means algorithm

2. Mini Batch k-means [2]

3. k-means++ [3,4]

4. Bisecting k-means [5]
